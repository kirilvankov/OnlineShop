# Project Introduction


OnlineShop is my defense project for ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni (June-August 2021). Project is built on ASP.NET CORE MVC - Framework.
It is an application for selling various products.

# Used Roles
There are three roles in the application
Administrator, Shop Owner, and User

# Overview
Users can add products to their cart and shop.

Users can apply for their own store and offer their own products for sale.
The user becomes a store owner after approval by the administrator.

The administrator can manage all the content of the products.

A store owner can only manage their own products. The administrator is seeded in application.

Users can complete their orders through PayPal payment and view their placed orders after successful payment.
